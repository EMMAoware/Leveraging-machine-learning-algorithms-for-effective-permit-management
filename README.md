# Leveraging-machine-learning-algorithms-for-effective-permit-management

### Project Overview
The project used different machine learning algorithms to predict the amount of money to be paid by companies seeking to import certain chemicals into the country 
by applying for an import permit from one of Ghana's regulatory agencies.

This was done to:
- Ensure that monetary loss to the Commission resulting from mistakes made by manually calculating figures was resolved.
- Improve efficiency for the entire permit management process. 

### Dataset
The dataset was sourced from the regulatory agency. The names of the actual companies were however not included in the analysis. The dataset included the
following variables: 
- Date Prepared
- Chemical Name
- Quantity
- Unit (Kg/L)
- Permit Type
- Permit Number 
- Amount Paid (Target feature) 
- Date Issued
